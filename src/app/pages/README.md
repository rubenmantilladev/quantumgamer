# Application Pages (Initial Stage)

Welcome to the "pages" folder in our Angular project. At this early stage, this folder is a placeholder for the pages that will comprise the various views and sections of our application.

## Purpose

The "pages" folder is intended to house the different pages of our application. Each page represents a specific view or section of our application, and while this folder is currently empty, it will be populated as our project progresses.

## Upcoming Pages

Here are some of the pages that will be added to the "pages" folder as our project evolves:

- **Home Page**: We plan to create a home page as the main entry point for our application.

- **Product Listing Page**: This page will display a list of products available in our application.

- **User Profile Page**: We will create a user profile page to showcase user information and settings.

## Customization

As development progresses, we will customize and populate the "pages" folder with the necessary components and templates to represent the different views and sections of our application.

Happy coding!
