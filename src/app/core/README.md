# Core Layer (Initial Stage)

Welcome to the "core" folder in our Angular project. At this stage, this folder is a placeholder for the core layer of our application, which will play a crucial role in structuring our project.

## Purpose

The "core" layer is intended to serve as the heart of our application, providing a central place for core functionalities and shared services. While it's currently empty, in the future, this folder will house key components that are essential for the functioning of the entire application.

## Upcoming Features

Here are some of the features and components that will be added to the "core" layer as our project progresses:

- **Shared Services**: We plan to create shared services in this folder. These services will centralize common logic, ensuring code reusability and maintainability.

- **Interceptors**: In the future, we'll implement HTTP interceptors in this layer. HTTP interceptors allow us to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests and responses throughout the application. This is useful for tasks such as adding headers, handling errors, or implementing authentication mechanisms.

## Customization

As development progresses, we will customize and populate the "core" layer with the necessary components and services to support our application's functionality.

Happy coding!
