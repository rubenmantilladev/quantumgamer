# Shared Components and Modules (Initial Stage)

Welcome to the "shared" folder in our Angular project. At this early stage, this folder serves as a placeholder for shared components and modules that will be utilized in various parts of our application.

## Purpose

The "shared" folder will play a crucial role in promoting code reuse and maintaining consistency in the user interface of our application. While it's currently empty, it will be populated as our project progresses.

## Upcoming Shared Components and Modules

Here are some of the shared components and modules that will be added to the "shared" folder as our project evolves:

- **Navbar Component**: We plan to create a reusable navigation bar component that will be used across multiple pages of our application.

- **Button Module**: This module will contain reusable button components with various styles and functionality.

- **Alert Component**: We will create a versatile alert component for displaying messages and notifications to users.

## Customization

As development progresses, we will customize and populate the "shared" folder with the necessary components and modules to ensure consistency in our application's user interface and promote code reuse.

Happy coding!
